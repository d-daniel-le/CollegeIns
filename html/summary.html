                    <p>
                        CollegeIns has produced much clarity in providing the college vital performance metrics on the Dashboard. It makes it easy for students to see how colleges perform on academics, student support, and program success. The summary elaborates on what all its parameters mean, graduation rates, transfer success, program efficiency, and student support services. This helps students get a good picture of how each school fits their objectives.

                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many colleges listed on CollegeIns are proving to be very strong based on their dashboard data. For instance, Bellevue College maintains a strong transfer rate to major 4-year universities, such as the University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU). This high transfer success is also mirrored in the success of numerous highly sought academic pathways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the Student Success Goal charts present on the Dashboard, programs like Academic Transfer DTA, Nursing AAS-T, and Business DTA demonstrate some of the highest graduation rates of all programs offered, thus signifying student satisfaction, stability within the curriculum, and clear pathways toward their goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, a number of colleges have been expanding hybrid and online learning options, providing flexibility for working students and those with transportation challenges. They truly enable a greater number of students to access higher education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Support systems such as advising services, financial aid assistance, disability resource centers, and tutoring are other contributors to good student outcomes. Colleges excelling in those areas offer a greater degree of certainty for their students and steady progress towards completion or transfer.

                <div class="summary-item-3 bubble" id="summary-3">
                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>
                        The higher ranked programs are, however, are in need of improvement, as we see in the Dashboard data. Some departments are graduating at lower rates than their peers, evidently pointing to inadequate resource allocation, faculty accessibility, or perhaps structures of academic support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The manner in which students seeking support for work study, strong disability accommodations, or public transportation definitely also runs into challenges at certain colleges that have limited or inconsistent services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another recurring challenge evident in the summary data is the weak digital outreach presence. Colleges with stagnant program web pages or poorly managed online resources might erect barriers for students trying to understand course information, faculty qualification, or program relevance. Weak digital outreach impacts less visibility, making it more difficult for students to assess the college's strengths in academics.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="summary-item-4 bubble" id="summary-4">
                    <h3>Overall Assessment</h3>
                    <p>
                        CollegeIns also analyzes how effectively each college supports students outside the classroom. This includes reviewing financial aid services, disability accommodations, program specific support, academic advising, and career development opportunities. Other factors such as the availability of hybrid courses, the strength of transfer pathways, and the presence of work study options are also evaluated and explained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By examining these resource categories, students gain a clear understanding of how well the college can support their academic progress, personal needs, and long term goals. The evaluation highlights both strong support systems and any gaps that may affect the student experience.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                    <p>
                        CollegeIns displays visual representations of the college's key performance metrics using charts and graphs that can be viewed by clicking "Dashboard" tab. These visuals include program completion rates, transfer efficiency, enrollment trends, demographic breakdowns, and career outcome statistics. The charts help users quickly spot performance patterns, strengths, and areas that need attention without reading through long text or tables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the current prototype, these charts serve as placeholders showing what future real time, dynamically updated visualizations will look like. Eventually, the system will pull live data directly from colleges, giving students an even deeper understanding of how each institution performs across multiple categories.
